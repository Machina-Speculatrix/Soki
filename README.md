the complete project involves items, such as:

- Arduino Nano
- HC-SR04
- mpu6050
- Mini L298n motor driver
- Two LI-ion battery(from old laptop setup)
- BO motors 150RPM
- Two mini wheels
- Mini aluminum framed, slef designed.
- Nuts, bolts and screws
- connecting wires


THE PROJECTS:

The project starts with designing the frame, and attaching the BO motorsand making a platform for the Electronics, soldering connecting ribbon wires to the motors and connecting to the pcb to the motor driver.
